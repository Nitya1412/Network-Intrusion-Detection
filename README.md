# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Detects whether a single network connection record is benign (normal) or an intrusion (attack). 

How to run:
1. Open command prompt in this folder.
2. Run: run_flask.bat
   - This will create a venv, install requirements, generate synthetic train/test CSVs, train a model (rf_model.pkl), and start the Flask server.
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to use the HTML form.
